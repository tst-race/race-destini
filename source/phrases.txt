A blessing in disguise
A dime a dozen
Beat around the bush
Better late than never
Bite the bullet
Break a leg
Call it a day
Cut somebody some slack
Cutting corners
Easy does it
Get out of hand
Get something out of your system     
Do the thing you've been wanting to do so you can move on
Get your act together
Give someone the benefit of the doubt 
Trust what someone says
Go back to the drawing board
Hang in there
Don't give up
Hit the sack
Go to sleep
It's not rocket science
Let someone off the hook
Make a long story short
Miss the boat
No pain, no gain
You have to work for what you want
On the ball
Doing a good job  
Pull someone's leg
To joke with someone 
Pull yourself together
Calm down 
So far so good
Speak of the devil     
The person we were just talking about showed up!
That's the last straw  
My patience has run out 
The best of both worlds
Time flies when you're having fun 
You don't notice how long something lasts when it's fun
To get bent out of shape
To get upset   
To make matters worse
Under the weather
We'll cross that bridge when we come to it 
Let's not talk about that problem right now
Wrap your head around something
You can say that again
Your guess is as good as mine
A bird in the hand is worth two in the bush
A penny for your thoughts   
Tell me what you're thinking 
A penny saved is a penny earned
A perfect storm
A picture is worth 1000 words
Actions speak louder than words
Add insult to injury To make a bad situation worse
Barking up the wrong tree    
Looking for solutions in the wrong place
Birds of a feather flock together  
People who are alike are often friends 
Bite off more than you can chew
Break the ice Make people feel more comfortable
By the skin of your teeth Just barely
Comparing apples to oranges    
Comparing two things that cannot be compared
Costs an arm and a leg
Do something at the drop of a hat   
Do something without having planned beforehand
Do unto others as you would have them do unto you
Don't count your chickens before they hatch   
Don't count on something good happening until it's happened.
Don't cry over spilt milk 
Don't complain about something that can't be fixed 
Don't give up your day job
Don't put all your eggs in one basket
Every cloud has a silver lining
Get a taste of your own medicine
Give someone the cold shoulder
Go on a wild goose chase
Good things come to those who wait
He has bigger fish to fry 
He has bigger things to take care of than what we are talking about now
He's a chip off the old block
Hit the nail on the head
Ignorance is bliss  You're better off not knowing      
It ain't over till the fat lady sings This isn't over yet 
It takes one to know one
You're just as bad as I am 
It's a piece of cake
It's easy
It's raining cats and dogs
Kill two birds with one stone
Let the cat out of the bag
Live and learn
Look before you leap   
Take only calculated risks
On thin ice 
If you make another mistake
There will be trouble
Once in a blue moon
Play devil's advocate
Put something on ice
Rain on someone's parade  
To spoil something
Saving for a rainy day
Slow and steady wins the race
Spill the beans
Take a rain check    
Postpone a plan
Take it with a grain of salt  
Dont take it too seriously 
The ball is in your court     
It's your decision
The best thing since sliced bread  
A really good invention   
The devil is in the details 
It looks good from a distance 
But when you look closer
There are problems
The early bird gets the worm   
The first people who arrive will get the best stuff   
The elephant in the room       
The big issue
The problem people are avoiding
The whole nine yards
There are other fish in the sea
There's a method to his madness
There's no such thing as a free lunch
Throw caution to the wind  
Take a risk
You can't have your cake and eat it too
You can't judge a book by its cover 
This person or thing may look bad
But it's good inside
A little learning is a dangerous thing
A snowball effect 
Events have momentum 
Build upon each other    
A snowball's chance in hell   
No chance at all
A stitch in time saves nine   
Fix the problem now because it will get worse later
A storm in a teacup    
A big fuss about a small problem
An apple a day keeps the doctor away
An ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure
As right as rain   
Perfect
Bolt from the blue     
Something that happened without warning
Burn bridges
Destroy relationships   
Calm before the storm
Something bad is coming,
But right now it's calm
Come rain or shine
No matter what   
Curiosity killed the cat
Stop asking questions 
Cut the mustard
Don't beat a dead horse
Every dog has his day
Familiarity breeds contempt
Fit as a fiddle
Fortune favours the bold   
Take risks  
Get a second wind   
Have more energy after having been tired
Get wind of something
Go down in flames
Haste makes waste
Have your head in the clouds
He who laughs last laughs loudest   
I'll get you back for what you did
Hear something straight from the horse's mouth
He's not playing with a full deck
He's off his rocker   
He's crazy
He's sitting on the fence  
He can't make up his mind
It is a poor workman who blames his tools   
If you can't do the job, don't blame it on others
It is always darkest before the dawn
It takes two to tango
Jump on the bandwagon
Know which way the wind is blowing 
Understand the situation 
Leave no stone unturned
Let sleeping dogs lie
Like riding a bicycle
Like two peas in a pod
Make hay while the sun shines
On cloud nine  
Very happy
Once bitten, twice shy
Out of the frying pan and into the fire
Run like the wind 
Run fast     
Shape up or ship out  
Work better or leave  
Snowed under
That ship has sailed  It's too late
The pot calling the kettle black
There are clouds on the horizon
Those who live in glass houses shouldn't throw stones
Through thick and thin
Time is money 
Work quickly 
Waste not, want not
We see eye to eye
Weather the storm
Well begun is half done
When it rains it pours
You can catch more flies with honey than you can with vinegar
You can lead a horse to water, but you can't make him drink
You can't make an omelet without breaking some eggs   
There's always a cost to doing something
A good thing that seemed bad at first
Avoid saying what you mean, 
Because it is uncomfortable
Better to arrive late than not to come at all  
To get something over with because it is inevitable   
Good luck
Stop working on something
Don't be so critical 
Doing something poorly in order to save time or money
Slow down
Get out of control 
Work better or leave
Start over  
To not hold someone responsible for something
It's too late
On the ball 
Doing a good job  
Pull someone's leg  
To joke with someone 
Pull yourself together 
Calm down 
Things are going well so far
That's the last straw  
My patience has run out 
An ideal situation   
To get bent out of shape      
Im upset   
Makes a problem worse   
Sick 
Understand something complicated     
I have no idea 
What you have is worth more than what you might have later
A penny for your thoughts   
Tell me what you're thinking 
Money you save today you can spend later
The worst possible situation
Better to show than tell 
Believe what people do and not what they say
Take on a project that you cannot finish
Very expensive
Treat people fairly. 
Also known as 
The Golden Rule
Don't cry over spilt milk 
There's no reason to complain about 
Something that can't be fixed 
You're not very good at this
What you're doing is too risky
Get treated the way you've been treating others 
Be patient
The son is like the father 
Get something exactly right   
Ignorance is bliss  
You're better off not knowing      
It ain't over till the fat lady sings 
This isn't over yet 
It takes one to know one   
You're just as bad as I am 
It's raining hard
Get two things done with a single action
Give away a secret  
I made a mistake  
Rarely 
To argue the opposite, 
Just for the sake of argument
Put on hold
Saving money for later 
Reliability is more important than speed
Give away a secret
Take it with a grain of salt  
Dont take it too seriously 
The best thing since sliced bread  
A really good 
The early bird gets the worm   
The first people who arrive will get the best stuff   
Everything, all the way.
Nothing is entirely free    
You can't have everything
People who don't understand 
Something 
fully dangerous
A snowball effect 
Events have momentum 
Build upon each other    
Apples are good for you
You can prevent a problem with little effort
Fixing it later is harder
Burn bridges  
Destroy relationships   
Come rain or shine    
No matter what   
Curiosity killed the cat 
Stop asking questions 
Do a good job
Move on, this subject is over
Everyone gets a chance at least once
The better you know someone the less you like him
In good health   
Fortune favours the bold   
Take risks  
Hear news of something secret 
Fail spectacularly
You'll make mistakes 
Rush through something
Not be concentrating 
Hear something from the person involved
He's dumb    
Things are going to get better 
One person alone isn't responsible. 
Both people are involved.
Follow a trend
Do what everyone else is doing  
Know which way the wind is blowing 
Understand the situation 
Look everywhere
Stop discussing an issue 
Something you never forget how to do  
They're always together
Take advantage of a good situation
Things are going from bad to worse
Run like the wind Run fast     
Shape up or ship out  
Work better 
Leave  
Busy 
Someone criticizing someone else he is just as bad
People who are morally questionable shouldn't criticize others 
In good times and in bad times
Time is money 
Work quickly 
Don't waste things and you'll always have enough
We agree    
Go through something difficult
Getting a good start is important
Everything is going wrong at once
You'll get what you want by being nice
You can't force someone to make the right decision
